"""Setuptools based setup script for TimeScale

You can use Setuptools (https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to automatically handle dependencies. For the easiest installation
just type the command (you'll probably need root privileges for that):
	python setup.py install
This will install the library in the default location. For instructions on
how to customize the install procedure read the output of:
	python setup.py --help install
In addition, there are some other commands:
	python setup.py clean -> will clean all trash (*.pyc and stuff)
	python setup.py test  -> will run the complete test suite
	python setup.py bench -> will run the complete benchmark suite
	python setup.py audit -> will run pyflakes checker on source code
To get a full list of available commands, read the output of:
	python setup.py --help-commands
Or, if all else fails, feel free to write at
caznaranl@uni.pe and ask for help.
