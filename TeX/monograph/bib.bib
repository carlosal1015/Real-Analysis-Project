  abstract = {The study of dynamic equations on time scales, which goes back to its founder Stefan Hilger (1988), is an area of mathematics that has recently received a lot of attention. It has been created in order to unify the study of differential and difference equations. In this paper we give an introduction to the time scales calculus. We also present various properties of the exponential function on an arbitrary time scale, and use it to solve linear dynamic equations of first order. Several examples and applications, among them an insect population model, are considered. We then use the exponential function to define hyperbolic and trigonometric functions and use those to solve linear dynamic equations of second order with constant coefficients. Finally, we consider self-adjoint equations and, more generally, so-called symplectic systems, and present several results on the positivity of quadratic functionals.},
